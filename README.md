# FleetioDemo

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 or later
- Fleetio API Key / Token

## Configure API Credentials

I have not included any API credentials so new ones will need to be added into the Config file.

`FleetioDemo/Configs/Debug.xcconfig`

```ENV
API_KEY = 
API_TOKEN = 
```

## Tests

I have included automated GHA tests these can be manually triggered - https://github.com/DevonJerothe/FleetioDemo/actions/workflows/unit-test-workflow.yml

You can also run locally via fastlane or regularly via Xcode
